Guide to Painting a Wood Surface with Gloss Finish Indoors

1. Preparing the Surface:
- Start by cleaning the wood surface thoroughly to remove any dirt, grease, or dust. Use a mild detergent and water solution and a clean cloth or sponge.
- If there are any existing paint or varnish, sand the surface lightly to create a smooth base for the new paint. Wipe away any sanding dust with a damp cloth.

2. Repair and Patch:
- Inspect the wood for any cracks, holes, or imperfections. Fill these areas with wood filler and smooth it out using a putty knife. Allow the filler to dry completely and sand it lightly for a smooth finish.

3. Priming:
- Since you have mentioned an environmental concern, it is recommended to use an eco-friendly and low VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) primer. These primers are environmentally safe and have minimal odor.
- Apply the primer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Use a paintbrush or roller to ensure even coverage. Allow the primer to dry completely before moving to the next step.

4. Choosing the Right Paint:
- Select a high-quality gloss paint in the colors you have mentioned: Chelsea Mauve (SW 0002), Rose Brocade (SW 0004), Deepest Mauve (SW 0005), Toile Red (SW 0006), Decorous Amber (SW 0007).
- Look for a water-based gloss paint that is specifically designed for interior wood surfaces. These paints are durable, easy to clean, and provide a shiny finish.

5. Painting:
- Stir the paint thoroughly before use.
- Start by cutting in edges and corners using a smaller brush, then use a roller for larger areas. This will ensure a smooth and consistent application.
- Apply the paint in thin, even coats, working in one direction. Avoid overloading the brush or roller as it may result in drips or sagging.
- Allow each coat to dry completely according to the manufacturer's instructions before applying the next coat. Multiple coats may be required to achieve the desired depth of color and shine.

6. Clean Up:
- Clean your brushes, rollers, and other painting tools immediately after use. Use water for water-based paint or mineral spirits for oil-based paint. Follow the paint manufacturer's instructions for proper cleaning.
- Dispose of any leftover paint, empty cans, and other waste in accordance with local regulations for environmental safety.

7. Finishing Touches:
- Once the final coat of paint has dried completely, inspect the surface for any imperfections. Touch up any missed spots or uneven areas.
- Enjoy your newly painted wood surface with a beautiful super shiny (gloss) finish.
